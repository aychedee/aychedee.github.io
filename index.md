## Hi I'm Hansel

This document is some information about how to get the most out of me as a manager. It's not meant to replace the personal relationship we will have but it's a good place to start. 

### What my roles is as a manager

I am trying to build a really great engineering department. To me that means finding people who are interested in the work we do here and providing them with the very best environment for doiing it. 

I am especially interested in building systems that automate the most anything dangerous, repetitive, or boring so that everyone can focus on solving the higher order problems that we face. 

### Feedback

Whenever you have feedback about me please give it to me. If you don't feel comfortable giving it to me directly. Please give it to another manager anonymously. 

If you want feedback from me then please ask me directly. I try to give timely relevant feedback to people but I can't always do this as much as some people need. 

### 1-to-1s 

If I am your line manager then I will put 30 minutes into your calendar once every week. This is not something you need to prepare for. It's not a status update on your projects. 

The format for these meetings can vary a lot depending on what is going on. But they are first and foremost _your time_. Are there things that are bothering you? Do you want to know something about the business that isn't clear?
